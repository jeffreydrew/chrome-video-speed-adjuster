This project is a chrome extension that changes HTML video speed to 2.5 once the keys Ctrl+Alt+L is clicked

[1/11/23] [MOST RECENT]:<br />
As of 1/11/23 the speed is now truly "adjustable" and **no longer uses Ctrl+Alt+L** <br />
d/D key adds 0.5 to video playspeed <br />
s/S key subtracts 0.5 from video playspeed <br />
r/R key resets video playspeed to 1 <br />
